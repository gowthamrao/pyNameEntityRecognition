A pivotal antitrust ruling aimed at addressing Google’s search monopoly may have handed Microsoft its best competitive opening in many years — but it’s still a slim one, and it’s not clear if the Redmond company will even consider it worth the effort.

In the long-awaited decision Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta barred Google from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on browsers and smartphones, such as the search giant’s longstanding deal involving Apple’s iPhone.

But under the ruling, Google can still spend billions to secure default slots, as long as partners remain free to preload or promote rivals. That leaves Microsoft to fight both Google’s scale and its checkbook.

So as an additional fix, Mehta also ordered Google to syndicate its organic search results and text ads to rivals for up to five years on commercially reasonable terms. For Microsoft, that could mean the ability to offer its users search results and ads backed by Google’s industry-leading index.

That could help Microsoft’s Bing search engine — and by extension its Copilot chatbot — compete more effectively against Google’s search dominance. The stakes are higher than ever given the foundational role of search in the emerging world of artificial intelligence.

But it’s not clear if Microsoft will try to take advantage of the remedies. Contacted by GeekWire on Wednesday, a spokesperson said the company had no comment on the ruling.
